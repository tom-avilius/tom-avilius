    “When you play the game of codes, you stash or you commit. After all, keywords are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Sometimes, all it takes to add a feature is to see what others overlook. And in the end, evil is evil, lesser, greater, middling...It's all the same. If I'm to choose between one and the other, I'd rather not choose at all.”<br><br>
