    “When you play the game of codes, you stash or you commit. After all, keywords are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Sometimes, all it takes to add a feature is to see what others overlook. And in the end, a feature is a feature, lesser, greater, middling...It's all the same. If I'm to choose between one feature and another, I'd rather not choose at all.”<br><br>
