    “When you play the game of codes, you win or you learn. After all, words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Sometimes, all it takes to solve the case is to see what others overlook. And in the end, evil is evil, lesser, greater, middling... If I'm to choose between one and the other, I'd rather not choose at all—I'd rather create.”<br><br>
